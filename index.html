      <h2>About the Teacher</h2>
      <p class="lead">Fun lessons in a friendly atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Hello, my name is Shin-Yin Estes. I’ve been providing students of all skill levels with professional piano training for more than 25 years.&nbsp;I believe it’s difficult&nbsp;for those looking to learn piano to find a teacher that can guide&nbsp;at any skill level, from absolute beginner to concert-ready. It’s rare to find someone&nbsp;with a high-quality music education, actual experience performing in front of large audiences, and years of practical experience teaching. It is my goal to take these&nbsp;accomplishments and put them at your disposal to give you the personalized piano education that you or your loved ones deserve.</p>
      <p>A strong understanding of music is essential to learning any instrument. I take special care to make sure my beginner students form a solid musical foundation that they can build upon for years to come. I teach in many styles of music, such as classical, jazz, and pop. &nbsp;I offer lessons to people of all ages and all levels of experience. &nbsp;Why not give yourself or your family a lifetime of musical enrichment?</p>
      <p>Lessons and event booking are available to Camden county New Jersey and surrounding areas, including eastern Philadelphia. &nbsp;For specific questions about areas of coverage please <a href="#signup">contact the teacher</a>.</p>
      <strong>2nd intro (blend this with the content above)</strong>
